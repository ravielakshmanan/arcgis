            In Kaliapat, a coastal village in India, Kuntala Rout spends as many as four hours a day filling up vessels with water so her family has enough to drink. Rout says she tries to drink as little water as she can to avoid extra trips to the hand pump. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Rout is not alone. From Kaliapat, to communities along Utah’s northern border in the U.S., to cities in central Argentina, water availability is a pressing issue that transcends borders.
            <br>
            <br>
            Unprecedented climate change, which is exacerbating sea-level rise, droughts and changes in rainfall, is worsening the problem. For many communities, it already has.
            <br>
            <br>
            This project, NOAH, makes water data accessible and understandable. It shows you how much surface water and rainfall has changed near you so you can  better understand your surroundings. 
            <br>
            <br>
            NOAH is built for anyone interested in learning about their environment. To see how your community is doing, click its location on the map, or use the search bar function. Start exploring!

          <strong>Origin story:</strong> The idea for NOAH came in early 2018. Pietro Ceccato, a climate scientist, was teaching a course at Columbia University’s medical school on how to infuse climate data into public health work. Disha Shetty, a health journalist from India who was working toward her master’s in journalism, walked into the classroom to learn how to better using data in reporting on unprecedented climate changes. After a few courses, the two began chatting about a project that would combine journalism and climate data.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          While data on changes in surface water was available through the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre, it wasn’t combined with rainfall trends in a single map. Combining the two in NOAH paints a more complete picture of changes in the water cycle and highlights the impacts of human interventions.

            Water availability dictates the wellbeing of entire communities. Yet, we tend to know very little about our water supplies.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            The goal is to make information about water more accessible to all. In regions where the amount of water in lakes and rivers has changed substantially, governments treat water data as a national secret. Recently, as more dams, dikes and even homes have been built along waterways, downstream effects have manifested. For example, in southern Louisiana and coastal Bangladesh, dams constructed upstream have blocked water supply to communities downstream.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            By comparing changes in the water surface level and rainfall highs and lows, you can begin to identify whether your community has been affected and how much.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            More greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere brings higher temperatures and more weather extremes. Rainfall is not immune. There are longer droughts alongside more erratic monsoons. Trying to adjust to new and extreme rainfall patterns is a mounting challenge. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            We’ve recorded the unprecedented changes in our climate, now let’s bake them into how we understand and interact with our surroundings.

            NOAH gives journalists  rich opportunities to discover, report and tell stories. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Touring the world in NOAH, you can find a town where  the community’s reservoir is severely depleted, but rainfall has remained stable; raising questions about water management or upstream engineering. You may also stumble upon an area where little has changed on the surface, but where rainfall highs and lows have fluctuated dramatically. How has that changed the communities?
            <br/>
            <br/>
            If you’re a journalist covering a particular area, you can request the raw data for that region. When a climate or water event crops up, you can access both historical and modern-day data to inform your reporting.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            The journalists on our team are available to guide you through the map, talk through story ideas and share tips on climate reporting. If you reach out to us at water.appspot@gmail.com, one of our journalists will respond within the week and set up a time to chat.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            We would also like to take this opportunity to express our gratitude to <a href="https://brown.columbia.edu/">The Brown Institute for Media Innovation</a>, without whose support this project would not have been possible.

            Sources: The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Climate Prediction Center’s Climate Anomaly Monitoring System_OPI provided monthly rainfall data going back to 1978. Columbia University’s International Research Institute for Climate and Society houses this information and presents it in <a href="http://iridl.ldeo.columbia.edu/maproom/Global/Precipitation/Anomaly.html#tabs-1">its own online map</a>.

            The global surface water data is courtesy of the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre. Using three million Landsat satellite images, a four-person team at the centre quantified the changes in global surface water between 1984 and 2015. The team published their findings and analysis in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature20584">Nature in December 2016</a>.
