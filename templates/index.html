          <h4>Breaking Things Down</h4>
          <p class="left-align light">
            <strong>Origin story:</strong> The idea for this map began in the early months of 2018. Pietro Ceccato, a climate scientist, was teaching a course at Columbia University’s medical school on how to infuse data into climate and public health work. Disha Shetty, a health journalist from India who was working toward her master’s in journalism, walked into the classroom already having wrestled with how to report on unprecedented climate changes. After a few courses, the two began chatting about a project that would combine journalism and climate data. While data on changes in surface water was available through the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre, it wasn’t combined with rainfall trends in a single map. Combining the two  paints a more complete picture of what’s happening to water, and highlights the impacts of human-made interventions.
            <br>
            <br>
            At its core, the project was driven by the sheer extent that water availability dictates the wellbeing of entire communities--and yet how little communities tend to know about their water surroundings. 
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Why this stuff matters:</strong> WHY WATER/RAINFALL DATA : BLURB FROM PROF. PIETRO
            <br>
            <br>
            The ultimate goal is to make information about water more accessible to all. In areas in the world where the amount of water that populates lakes and rivers has substantially changed, water data can be treated as a national secret. As more dams, dikes and even homes have been constructed along waterways in the last few decades--downstream effects have manifested. By comparing changes in the water-surface level and rainfall highs and lows, you can begin to identify how and whether your community has been affected, and how much.
            <br>
            <br>
            GRAF ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE ROLE. Increased levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere mean higher temperatures and more extremes. Rainfall is not immune. There are longer droughts alongside heavier monsoons. In communities where rainfall levels have become more extreme, trying to adjust can be life-ending.
            <br>
            <br>
            We’ve recorded the unprecedented changes in our climate, now let’s bake them into how we understand and approach our surroundings. 
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Calling all journalists:</strong> Within this map are rich opportunities for journalists to find and tell stories. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Touring the world on this map, you can find an area where the amount of water in a town’s reservoir has severely depleted--but where rainfall has remained consistent--begging questions of water management or upstream engineering. You might also stumble upon an area where not much has changed on the surface, but where there have been huge spikes and drops in rainfall highs and lows. How has that changed the communities?
            <br>
            <br>
            If you’re a journalist covering a particular area, you can request the raw data for that space. When a climate or water event crops up, you’ll have historical and modern-day data to inform your reporting.
            <br>
            <br>
            The journalists on our team are available to guide you through the map, talk through story ideas and share tips on climate reporting. We have also cultivated a list of water and climate-related experts who are ready to work with you to answer questions and explain any unique findings you might come across. If you reach out to us at <a href="mailto:water.appspot@gmail.com">water.appspot@gmail.com</a>, one of our journalists will respond within the week and set up a time to chat about these possibilities.

            Sources: The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Climate Prediction Center’s Climate Anomaly Monitoring System_OPI provided monthly rainfall data going back to 1978. Columbia University’s International Research Institute houses this information in <a href="http://iridl.ldeo.columbia.edu/maproom/Global/Precipitation/Anomaly.html#tabs-1">its own map</a>.

            <br>
            The global surface water data is courtesy of the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre. Using three million Landsat satellite images, a four-person team at the centre quantified the changes in global surface water between 1984 and 2015. The team published their findings and analysis in Nature in December 2016. Check out their findings <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature20584">here</a>.
